# bioinformatics-dna-sequencer
Python tool to generate dna sequence data.
1. Validate a DNA sequence from a file.
2. Calculate:
    Sequence length
    GC content
    Nucleotide frequencies
3. Identify and count motifs (short, repeating patterns)

Why Biopython?

Efficient sequence handling: Biopython's Seq and SeqRecord objects simplify manipulations.
Built-in algorithms: GC content, motif finding, and more are already implemented.
FASTA, GenBank support: Easily extendable to other file formats.
